# Real-Time-Secure-Chat-Application

## Introduction:
In this project We will Develop a real-time secure chat application from scratch like WhatsApp & Signal with end-to-end encryption. Our project will cover:
-	Socket Programming
-	Real-Time System 
-	End-to-end Encryption 

## Our secure chat will provide the following:
-	Multi-User group chat application
-	Users can choose between encryption modes:
    -	Single key (DES) 
    -	Two keys (RSA , EL GAMAL) 
-	TTP (Third Trusted Party) which facilitates interactions between two parties who both trust the third party

## Technology Stack:
-	Python as the server-side language
-	Tkinter library for UI
-	Socket library for real-time message exchange
